# University-Project-Remote-Controlled-Model-Car
This is a project about a selfmade remote controlled model car. It is controlled by using a Xbox-Controller which communicates with a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth. It was carried out with two fellow students. Its hardware was created in SolidWorks and manufactured with carbon panels and 3D-printing. It controls the steering and a tipping loading area with two identical stepmotors as well as the actuator with a servo motor. This program was a part ot this project and I implemented by myself. For more information, reach out to me.
